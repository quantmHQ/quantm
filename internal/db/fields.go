	// Sensitive represents a string encrypted using AES-GCM.

	// It provides encryption and decryption of sensitive data within the application, ensuring that the data is stored
	// and transmitted securely without being exposed in plain text. This is particularly useful for protecting sensitive
	// values, both at rest and in motion.
	//
	// The encryption key is derived from a secret by calling shared.Service(). shared.Service is a singleton initialized
	// at application startup using environment variables.
